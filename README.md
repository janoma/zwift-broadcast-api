# Zwift Broadcast API Library

Type-safe access to Zwift's broadcast APIs.

**Caveat**. This library does _not_ give you access to the APIs, but if you _do_ have access, it should make it easy to work with them, especially from a server environment. Your regular Zwift login _does not work_ here.

For the APIs you can access with your Zwift login, take a look at [zwift-api-wrapper](https://github.com/rally25rs/zwift-api-wrapper).
